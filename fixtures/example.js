[ { subject: 'General', qa: [ { question: 'Q: What is changing?', answer: 'Starting July 2018, all newly created EC2 resources will receive longer format IDs. The new format will only apply to newly created resources; your existing resources won’t be affected. Instances and volumes already use this ID format. Through the end of June 2018, customers will have the ability to opt-in to use longer IDs. During this time, you can choose which ID format resources are assigned and update your management tools and scripts to add support for the longer format. Please visit this documentation for instructions.' }, { question: 'Q: Why is this necessary?', answer: 'Given how fast AWS continues to grow, we will start to run low on IDs for certain resources in 2018. In order to enable the long-term, uninterrupted creation of new resources, we need to introduce a longer ID format. All Amazon EC2 resource IDs will change to the longer format in July 2018.' }, { question: 'Q: I already opted in for longer IDs last year. Why do I need to opt-in again?', answer: 'In 2016, we moved to the longer ID format for Amazon EC2 instances, reservations, volumes, and snapshots only. This opt-in changes the ID format for all remaining EC2 resource types' }, { question: 'Q: What will the new identifier format look like?', answer: 'The new identifier format will follow the pattern of the current identifier format, but it will be longer. The new format will be -<17 characters>, e.g. “vpc-1234567890abcdef0” for VPCs or “subnet-1234567890abcdef0” for subnets.' }, { question: 'Q: How does this impact me?', answer: 'There is a good chance that you won’t need to make any system changes to handle the new format. If you only use the console to manage AWS resources, you might not be impacted at all, but you should still update your settings to use the longer ID format as soon as possible. If you interact with AWS resources via APIs, SDKs, or the AWS CLI, you might be impacted, depending on whether your software makes assumptions about the ID format when validating or persisting resource IDs. If this is the case, you might need to update your systems to handle the new format. Some failure modes could include:' }, { question: 'Q: Will this affect existing resources?', answer: 'No. Only resources that are created after you opt-in to the longer format will be affected. Once a resource has been assigned an ID (long or short), that ID will never change. Each ID is unique and will never be reused. Any resource created with the old ID format will always retain its shorter ID. Any resource created with the new format will retain its longer ID, even if you opt back out.' }, { question: 'Q: When will this happen?', answer: 'Through the end of June 2018, longer IDs will be available for opt-in via APIs and the EC2 Console. All accounts can opt-in and out of longer IDs as needed for testing. Starting on July 1, 2018, the option to switch formats will no longer be available, and newly created EC2 resources to receive longer IDs. All regions launching in July 2018 and onward will only support longer IDs.' }, { question: 'Q: Why is there an opt-in period?', answer: 'We want to give you as much time as possible to test your systems with the new format. This transition time offers maximum flexibility to test and update your systems incrementally and will help minimize interrupts as you add support for the new format, if necessary.' }, { question: 'Q: How do I opt in and out of receiving longer IDs?', answer: 'Throughout the transition period (Now through the end of June 2018), you can opt to receive longer or shorter IDs by using the APIs or the EC2 Console. Instructions are provided in this documentation.' }, { question: 'Q: What will happen if I take no action?', answer: 'If you do not opt-in to the new format during the transition period, you will be automatically begin receiving the longer format IDs after July 1, 2018. We do not recommend this approach. It is better to add support for the new format during the transition window, which offers the opportunity for controlled testing.' }, { question: 'Q: What if I prefer to keep receiving the shorter ID format after the end of June 2018?', answer: 'This is not possible regardless of your user settings specified.' }, { question: 'Q: When will the longer IDs’ final transition happen?', answer: 'In July 2018, your newly created resources will start to receive longer IDs. You can check the scheduled transition date for your each region by using the AWS CLI describe-id-format.' }, { question: 'Q: If I opt in to longer IDs and then opt back out during the transition period, what will happen to resources that were created with longer IDs?', answer: 'Once a resource has been assigned an ID it will not change, so resources that are created with longer IDs will retain the longer IDs regardless of later actions. If you opt in to the longer format, create resources, and then opt out, you will see a mix of long and short resource IDs, even after opting out. The only way to get rid of long IDs will be to delete or terminate the respective resources. For this reason, exercise caution and avoid creating critical resources with the new format until you have tested your tools and automation.' }, { question: 'Q: What should I do if my systems are not working as expected before the transition period ends?', answer: 'If your systems are not working as expected during the transition period, you can temporarily opt out of longer format IDs and remediate your systems, however your account will automatically be transitioned back to using longer IDs after the end of June 2018. Regardless of your account settings, all new resources will receive the longer format IDs, so it is important for you to test your systems with longer format IDs before the transition period ends. By testing and opting in earlier, you give yourself valuable time to make modifications to your resources with short resource IDs and you minimize the risk of any impact to your systems.' }, { question: 'Q: What will happen if I launch resources in multiple regions during the transition period?', answer: 'Your resources’ ID length will depend upon the region you launch your resources. If the region has already transitioned to using longer IDs, resources launched in that region will have longer format IDs; if not, they will have shorter resource IDs. Therefore, during the transition window, you may see a mix of shorter and longer resource IDs.' }, { question: 'Q: If AWS adds new regions during the transition period, will new regions support longer IDs?', answer: 'Yes. All new regions launching after July 2018 will issue longer format IDs by default for both new and existing accounts.' }, { question: 'Q: What will be the default ID type for new accounts?', answer: 'Accounts created on March 15, 2018 or later will be configured to receive the longer ID format by default in every AWS region except AWS GovCloud (US). If you are a new customer, this will make the transition to longer IDs really simple. If you would like your new account to assign the shorter ID format to your resources, then simply reconfigure your account for shorter IDs as described above. This workflow will be necessary until you are ready for your accounts to receive longer IDs.' }, { question: 'Q: Will I need to upgrade to a new version of the AWS SDKs or CLI?', answer: 'The following AWS CLI and SDKs are fully compatible with longer IDs: PHP v2.8.27+, PHP v3.15.0+, AWS CLI v1.10.2+, Boto3v1.2.1+, Botocorev1.3.24+, PHP v1, Boto v1, Boto v2, Ruby v1, Ruby v2, JavaScript, Java, .NET, AWS Tools for Windows PowerShell, and Go.' }, { question: 'Q: How can I test my systems with longer IDs?', answer: 'Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) with longer format IDs have been published for testing purposes.

However, data that is stored on an Amazon EBS volume will persist independently of the life of the instance. Therefore, we recommend that you use the local instance store for temporary data and, for data requiring a higher level of durability, we recommend using Amazon EBS volumes or backing up the data to Amazon S3. If you are using an Amazon EBS volume as a root partition, you will need to set the Delete On Terminate flag to "N" if you want your Amazon EBS volume to persist outside the life of the instance.' }, { question: 'Q: What kind of performance can I expect from Amazon EBS volumes?', answer: 'Amazon EBS provides four current generation volume types and are divided into two major categories: SSD-backed storage for transactional workloads and HDD-backed storage for throughput intensive workloads. These volume types differ in performance characteristics and price, allowing you to tailor your storage performance and cost to the needs of your applications.

These volumes deliver performance in terms of throughput, measured in MB/s, and include the ability to burst up to 250 MB/s per TB, with a baseline throughput of 40 MB/s per TB and a maximum throughput of 500 MB/s per volume. ST1 is designed to deliver the expected throughput performance 99% of the time and has enough I/O credits to support a full-volume scan at the burst rate.' }, { answer: 'SC1 volumes are backed by hard disk drives (HDDs) and provides the lowest cost per GB of all EBS volume types. It is ideal for less frequently accessed workloads with large, cold datasets. Similar to st1, sc1 provides a burst model: these volumes can burst up to 80 MB/s per TB, with a baseline throughput of 12 MB/s per TB and a maximum throughput of 250 MB/s per volume. For infrequently accessed data, sc1 provides extremely inexpensive storage. SC1 is designed to deliver the expected throughput performance 99% of the time and has enough I/O credits to support a full-volume scan at the burst rate.' }, { answer: 'To maximize the performance of st1 and sc1, we recommend using EBS-optimized EC2 instances.' }, { question: 'Q: Which volume type should I choose?', answer: 'Amazon EBS includes two major categories of storage: SSD-backed storage for transactional workloads (performance depends primarily on IOPS) and HDD-backed storage for throughput workloads (performance depends primarily on throughput, measured in MB/s). SSD-backed volumes are designed for transactional, IOPS-intensive database workloads, boot volumes, and workloads that require high IOPS. SSD-backed volumes include Provisioned IOPS SSD (io1) and General Purpose SSD (gp2). HDD-backed volumes are designed for throughput-intensive and big-data workloads, large I/O sizes, and sequential I/O patterns. HDD-backed volumes include Throughput Optimized HDD (st1) and Cold HDD (sc1).

Does the snapshot need to complete before the volume can be used again?', answer: 'No, snapshots can be done in real time while the volume is attached and in use. However, snapshots only capture data that has been written to your Amazon EBS volume, which might exclude any data that has been locally cached by your application or OS. In order to ensure consistent snapshots on volumes attached to an instance, we recommend cleanly detaching the volume, issuing the snapshot command, and then reattaching the volume. For Amazon EBS volumes that serve as root devices, we recommend shutting down the machine to take a clean snapshot.' }, { question: 'Q: Are snapshots versioned? Can I read an older snapshot to do a point-in-time recovery?', answer: 'Each snapshot is given a unique identifier, and customers can create volumes based on any of their existing snapshots.' }, { question: 'Q: What charges apply when using Amazon EBS shared snapshots?', answer: 'If you share a snapshot, you won’t be charged when other users make a copy of your snapshot. If you make a copy of another user’s shared volume, you will be charged normal EBS rates.' }, { question: 'Q: Can users of my Amazon EBS shared snapshots change any of my data?', answer: 'Users who have permission to create volumes based on your shared snapshots will first make a copy of the snapshot into their account. Users can modify their own copies of the data, but the data on your original snapshot and any other volumes created by other users from your original snapshot will remain unmodified.' }, { question: 'Q: How can I discover Amazon EBS snapshots that have been shared with me?', answer: 'You can find snapshots that have been shared with you by selecting “Private Snapshots” from the viewing dropdown in the Snapshots section of the AWS Management Console.
