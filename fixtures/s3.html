          <div class="lb-txt-16 lb-rtxt" style="color:#232F3E;"> 
           <p><b>Q:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; What does Amazon do with my data in Amazon S3?</b></p> 
           <p>Amazon will store your data and track its associated usage for billing purposes. Amazon will not otherwise access your data for any purpose outside of the Amazon S3 offering, except when required to do so by law. Please refer to the <a href="/agreement/" target="_blank">Amazon Web Services Licensing Agreement</a> for details.</p> 
          </div> 
          <div class="lb-txt-16 lb-rtxt" style="color:#232F3E;"> 
           <p><b>Q:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Does Amazon store its own data in Amazon S3? </b></p> 
           <p> Yes. Developers within Amazon use Amazon S3 for a wide variety of projects. Many of these projects use Amazon S3 as their authoritative data store and rely on it for business-critical operations.</p> 
          </div> 
          <div class="lb-txt-16 lb-rtxt" style="color:#232F3E;"> 
           <p><b>Q:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; How is Amazon S3 data organized? </b></p> 
           <p> Amazon S3 is a simple key-based object store. When you store data, you assign a unique object key that can later be used to retrieve the data. Keys can be any string, and they can be constructed to mimic hierarchical attributes. Alternatively, you can use S3 Object Tagging to organize your data across all of your S3 buckets and/or prefixes. <br /> </p>

          <div class="lb-txt-16 lb-rtxt" style="color:#232F3E;"> 
           <p><b>Q:&nbsp; Where is my data stored?</b></p> 
           <p>You specify an AWS Region when you create your Amazon S3 bucket. For S3 Standard, S3 Standard-IA, and S3 Glacier storage classes, your objects are automatically stored across multiple devices spanning a minimum of three Availability Zones, each separated by miles across an AWS Region. Objects stored in the S3 One Zone-IA storage class are stored redundantly within a single Availability Zone in the AWS Region you select. Please refer to <a href="/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regional-product-services/" target="_blank">Regional Products and Services</a> for details of Amazon S3 service availability by AWS Region.<br /> </p>

          <div class="lb-txt-16 lb-rtxt" style="color:#232F3E;"> 
           <p><b>Q:&nbsp; What is an AWS Region? </b></p> 
           <p> An AWS Region is a geographic location where AWS provides multiple, physically separated and isolated Availability Zones which are connected with low latency, high throughput, and highly redundant networking.</p> 
          </div> 
          <div class="lb-txt-16 lb-rtxt" style="color:#232F3E;"> 
           <p><b>Q:&nbsp; What is an AWS Availability Zone (AZ)?</b></p> 
           <p>An AWS Availability Zone is an isolated location within an AWS Region. Within each AWS Region, S3 operates in a minimum of three AZs, each separated by miles to protect against local events like fires, floods, etc.</p> 
           <p>Amazon S3 Standard, S3 Standard-Infrequent Access, and S3 Glacier storage classes replicate data across a minimum of three AZs to protect against the loss of one entire AZ. This remains true in Regions where fewer than three AZs are publicly available. Objects stored in these storage classes are available for access from all of the AZs in an AWS Region.</p> 
           <p>The Amazon S3 One Zone-IA storage class replicates data within a single AZ. Data stored in this storage class is susceptible to loss in an AZ destruction event.</p>

           <p><b>Q:&nbsp; How do I decide which AWS Region to store my data in? </b></p> 
           <p> There are several factors to consider based on your specific application. You may want to store your data in a Region that…</p> 
           <ul> 
            <li>...is near to your customers, your data centers, or your other AWS resources in order to reduce data access latencies.</li> 
           </ul> 
           <ul> 
            <li>...is remote from your other operations for geographic redundancy and disaster recovery purposes.</li> 
           </ul> 
           <ul> 
            <li>...enables you to address specific legal and regulatory requirements.</li> 
           </ul> 
           <ul> 
            <li>...allows you to reduce storage costs. You can choose a lower priced region to save money. For S3 pricing information, please visit the <a href="/s3/pricing/" target="_blank">S3 pricing page</a>.</li>

          <div class="lb-txt-16 lb-rtxt" style="color:#232F3E;"> 
           <p><b>Q:&nbsp; How much does Amazon S3 cost?</b></p> 
           <p>With Amazon S3, you pay only for what you use. There is no minimum fee. You can estimate your monthly bill using the <a href="http://calculator.s3.amazonaws.com/calc5.html" target="_blank">AWS Simple Monthly Calculator</a>.</p> 
           <p>We charge less where our costs are less. Some prices vary across Amazon S3 Regions. Billing prices are based on the location of your bucket. There is no Data Transfer charge for data transferred within an Amazon S3 Region via a COPY request. Data transferred via a COPY request between AWS Regions is charged at rates specified in the pricing section of the Amazon S3 detail page. There is no Data Transfer charge for data transferred between Amazon EC2 and Amazon S3 within the same region, for example, data transferred within the US East (Northern Virginia) Region. However, data transferred between Amazon EC2 and Amazon S3 across all other regions is charged at rates specified on the <a href="/s3/pricing/" target="_blank">Amazon S3 pricing page</a>, for example, data transferred between Amazon EC2 US East (Northern Virginia) and Amazon S3 US West (Northern California).</p> 
          </div> 
          <div class="lb-txt-16 lb-rtxt" style="color:#232F3E;"> 
           <p><b>Q:&nbsp; How will I be charged and billed for my use of Amazon S3?</b></p> 
           <p>There are no set-up fees or commitments to begin using the service. At the end of the month, your credit card will automatically be charged for that month’s usage. You can view your charges for the current billing period at any time on the Amazon Web Services web site, by logging into your Amazon Web Services account, and clicking “Account Activity” under “Your Web Services Account”.</p> 
           <p>With the <a href="/free/" target="_blank">AWS Free Usage Tier*</a>, you can get started with Amazon S3 for free in all regions except the AWS GovCloud Region. Upon sign-up, new AWS customers receive 5 GB of Amazon S3 Standard storage, 20,000 Get Requests, 2,000 Put Requests, 15GB of data transfer in, and 15GB of data transfer out each month for one year.</p> 
           <p>Amazon S3 charges you for the following types of usage. Note that the calculations below assume there is no AWS Free Tier in place.</p> 
           <p><b>Storage Used:</b></p> 
           <p>Amazon S3 storage pricing is summarized on the <a href="/s3/pricing/" target="_blank">Amazon S3 Pricing page</a>.</p> 
           <p>The volume of storage billed in a month is based on the average storage used throughout the month. This includes all object data and metadata stored in buckets that you created under your AWS account. We measure your storage usage in “TimedStorage-ByteHrs,” which are added up at the end of the month to generate your monthly charges.</p> 
           <p><b>Storage Example:</b></p> 
           <p>Assume you store 100GB (107,374,182,400 bytes) of data in Amazon S3 Standard in your bucket for 15 days in March, and 100TB (109,951,162,777,600 bytes) of data in Amazon S3 Standard for the final 16 days in March.</p> 
           <p>At the end of March, you would have the following usage in Byte-Hours: Total Byte-Hour usage = [107,374,182,400 bytes x 15 days x (24 hours / day)] + [109,951,162,777,600 bytes x 16 days x (24 hours / day)] = 42,259,901,212,262,400 Byte-Hours.</p> 
           <p>Let's convert this to GB-Months: 42,259,901,212,262,400 Byte-Hours / 1,073,741,824 bytes per GB / 744 hours per month = 52,900 GB-Months</p> 
           <p>This usage volume crosses two different volume tiers. The monthly storage price is calculated below assuming the data is stored in the US East (Northern Virginia) Region: 50 TB Tier: 51,200 GB x $0.023 = $1,177.60 50 TB to 450 TB Tier: 1,700 GB x $0.022 = $37.40</p> 
           <p>Total Storage Fee = $1,177.60 + $37.40 = $1,215.00</p> 
           <p><b>Network Data Transferred In:</b></p> 
           <p>Amazon S3 Data Transfer In pricing is summarized on the <a href="/s3/pricing/" target="_blank">Amazon S3 Pricing page</a>. This represents the amount of data sent to your Amazon S3 buckets.&nbsp;</p> 
           <p><b>Network Data Transferred Out:</b></p> 
           <p>Amazon S3 Data Transfer Out pricing is summarized on the <a href="/s3/pricing/" target="_blank">Amazon S3 Pricing page</a>. For Amazon S3, this charge applies whenever data is read from any of your buckets from a location outside of the given Amazon S3 Region.</p> 
           <p>Data Transfer Out pricing rate tiers take into account your aggregate Data Transfer Out from a given region to the Internet across Amazon EC2, Amazon S3, Amazon RDS, Amazon SimpleDB, Amazon SQS, Amazon SNS and Amazon VPC. These tiers do not apply to Data Transfer Out from Amazon S3 in one AWS Region to another AWS Region.</p> 
           <p><b>Data Transfer Out Example:</b><br /> Assume you transfer 1TB of data out of Amazon S3 from the US East (Northern Virginia) Region to the Internet every day for a given 31-day month. Assume you also transfer 1TB of data out of an Amazon EC2 instance from the same region to the Internet over the same 31-day month.</p> 
           <p>Your aggregate Data Transfer would be 62 TB (31 TB from Amazon S3 and 31 TB from Amazon EC2). This equates to 63,488 GB (62 TB * 1024 GB/TB).</p> 
           <p>This usage volume crosses three different volume tiers. The monthly Data Transfer Out fee is calculated below assuming the Data Transfer occurs in the US East (Northern Virginia) Region:<br /> 10 TB Tier: 10,239 GB (10&times;1024 GB/TB – 1 (free)) x $0.09 = $921.51<br /> 10 TB to 50 TB Tier: 40,960 GB (40&times;1024) x $0.085 = $3,481.60<br /> 50 TB to 150 TB Tier: 12,288 GB (remainder) x $0.070 = $860.16</p> 
           <p>Total Data Transfer Out Fee = $921.51+ $3,481.60 + $860.16= $5,263.27</p> 
           <p><b>Data Requests:</b></p> 
           <p>Amazon S3 Request pricing is summarized on the <a href="/s3/pricing/" target="_blank">Amazon S3 Pricing Chart</a>.</p> 
           <p>Request Example:<br /> Assume you transfer 10,000 files into Amazon S3 and transfer 20,000 files out of Amazon S3 each day during the month of March. Then, you delete 5,000 files on March 31st.<br /> Total PUT requests = 10,000 requests x 31 days = 310,000 requests<br /> Total GET requests = 20,000 requests x 31 days = 620,000 requests<br /> Total DELETE requests = 5,000&times;1 day = 5,000 requests</p> 
           <p>Assuming your bucket is in the US East (Northern Virginia) Region, the Request fees are calculated below:<br /> 310,000 PUT Requests: 310,000 requests x $0.005/1,000 = $1.55<br /> 620,000 GET Requests: 620,000 requests x $0.004/10,000 = $0.25<br /> 5,000 DELETE requests = 5,000 requests x $0.00 (no charge) = $0.00</p> 
           <p><b>Data Retrieval:</b></p> 
           <p>Amazon S3 data retrieval pricing applies for the S3 Standard-Infrequent Access (S3 Standard-IA) and S3 One Zone-IA storage classes and is summarized on the <a href="/s3/pricing/" target="_blank">Amazon S3 Pricing page</a>.</p> 
           <p><b>Data Retrieval Example:</b><br /> Assume in one month you retrieve 300GB of S3 Standard-IA, with 100GB going out to the Internet, 100GB going to EC2 in the same AWS region, and 100GB going to CloudFront in the same AWS Region.</p> 
           <p>Your data retrieval fees for the month would be calculated as 300GB x $0.01/GB = $3.00. Note that you would also pay network data transfer fees for the portion that went out to the Internet.</p>

           <p><b>Q: How am I charged for using Versioning?</b></p> 
           <p>Normal Amazon S3 rates apply for every version of an object stored or requested. For example, let’s look at the following scenario to illustrate storage costs when utilizing Versioning (let’s assume the current month is 31 days long):</p> 
           <p>1) Day 1 of the month: You perform a PUT of 4 GB (4,294,967,296 bytes) on your bucket.<br /> 2) Day 16 of the month: You perform a PUT of 5 GB (5,368,709,120 bytes) within the same bucket using the same key as the original PUT on Day 1.<br /> <br /> When analyzing the storage costs of the above operations, please note that the 4 GB object from Day 1 is not deleted from the bucket when the 5 GB object is written on Day 15. Instead, the 4 GB object is preserved as an older version and the 5 GB object becomes the most recently written version of the object within your bucket. At the end of the month:</p> 
           <p>Total Byte-Hour usage<br /> [4,294,967,296 bytes x 31 days x (24 hours / day)] + [5,368,709,120 bytes x 16 days x (24 hours / day)] = 5,257,039,970,304 Byte-Hours.</p> 
           <p>Conversion to Total GB-Months<br /> 5,257,039,970,304 Byte-Hours x (1 GB / 1,073,741,824 bytes) x (1 month / 744 hours) = 6.581 GB-Month</p> 
           <p>The fee is calculated based on the current rates for your region on the <a href="/s3/pricing/" target="_blank">Amazon S3 Pricing page</a>.</p>

           <p><b>Q:&nbsp; How secure is my data in Amazon S3?&nbsp;</b>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p> 
           <p>Amazon S3 is secure by default. Upon creation, only the resource owners have access to Amazon S3 resources they create. Amazon S3 supports user authentication to control access to data. You can use access control mechanisms such as bucket policies and Access Control Lists (ACLs) to selectively grant permissions to users and groups of users. The Amazon S3 console highlights your publicly accessible buckets, indicates the source of public accessibility, and also warns you if changes to your bucket policies or bucket ACLs would make your bucket publicly accessible.&nbsp;You should enable Block Public Access for all accounts and buckets that you do not want publicly accessible.</p> 
           <p>You can securely upload/download your data to Amazon S3 via SSL endpoints using the HTTPS protocol. If you need extra security you can use the Server-Side Encryption (SSE) option to encrypt data stored at rest. You can configure your Amazon S3 buckets to automatically encrypt objects before storing them if the incoming storage requests do not have any encryption information. Alternatively, you can use your own encryption libraries to encrypt data before storing it in Amazon S3.</p> 
          </div> 
          <div class="lb-txt-16 lb-rtxt" style="color:#232F3E;"> 
           <p><b>Q:&nbsp; How can I control access to my data stored on Amazon S3?</b></p> 
           <p>Customers may use four mechanisms for controlling access to Amazon S3 resources: Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies, bucket policies, Access Control Lists (ACLs), and Query String Authentication. IAM enables organizations with multiple employees to create and manage multiple users under a single AWS account. With IAM policies, customers can grant IAM users fine-grained control to their Amazon S3 bucket or objects while also retaining full control over everything the users do. With bucket policies, customers can define rules which apply broadly across all requests to their Amazon S3 resources, such as granting write privileges to a subset of Amazon S3 resources. Customers can also restrict access based on an aspect of the request, such as HTTP referrer and IP address. With ACLs, customers can grant specific permissions (i.e. READ, WRITE, FULL_CONTROL) to specific users for an individual bucket or object. With Query String Authentication, customers can create a URL to an Amazon S3 object which is only valid for a limited time. For more information on the various access control policies available in Amazon S3, please refer to the <a href="http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/index.html?UsingAuthAccess.html" target="_blank">Access Control topic</a> in the <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/Welcome.html" target="_blank">Amazon S3 Developer Guide</a>.</p>

           <p><b>Q:&nbsp; Does Amazon S3 support data access auditing?</b></p> 
           <p>Yes, customers can optionally configure an Amazon S3 bucket to create access log records for all requests made against it. Alternatively, customers who need to capture IAM/user identity information in their logs can configure <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/logging-management-and-data-events-with-cloudtrail.html" target="_blank">AWS CloudTrail Data Events</a>.</p> 
           <p>These access log records can be used for audit purposes and contain details about the request, such as the request type, the resources specified in the request, and the time and date the request was processed.</p> 
          </div> 
          <div class="lb-txt-16 lb-rtxt" style="color:#232F3E;"> 
           <p><b>Q:&nbsp; What options do I have for encrypting data stored on Amazon S3? </b></p> 
           <p> You can choose to encrypt data using SSE-S3, SSE-C, SSE-KMS, or a client library such as the <a href="http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AWSJavaSDK/latest/javadoc/com/amazonaws/services/s3/AmazonS3EncryptionClient.html" target="_blank">Amazon S3 Encryption Client</a>. All four enable you to store sensitive data encrypted at rest in Amazon S3.</p> 
           <p> SSE-S3 provides an integrated solution where Amazon handles key management and key protection using multiple layers of security. You should choose SSE-S3 if you prefer to have Amazon manage your keys.</p> 
           <p> SSE-C enables you to leverage Amazon S3 to perform the encryption and decryption of your objects while retaining control of the keys used to encrypt objects. With SSE-C, you don’t need to implement or use a client-side library to perform the encryption and decryption of objects you store in Amazon S3, but you do need to manage the keys that you send to Amazon S3 to encrypt and decrypt objects. Use SSE-C if you want to maintain your own encryption keys, but don’t want to implement or leverage a client-side encryption library.</p> 
           <p> SSE-KMS enables you to use <a href="/kms/" target="_blank">AWS Key Management Service</a> (AWS KMS) to manage your encryption keys. Using AWS KMS to manage your keys provides several additional benefits. With AWS KMS, there are separate permissions for the use of the master key, providing an additional layer of control as well as protection against unauthorized access to your objects stored in Amazon S3. AWS KMS provides an audit trail so you can see who used your key to access which object and when, as well as view failed attempts to access data from users without permission to decrypt the data. Also, AWS KMS provides additional security controls to support customer efforts to comply with PCI-DSS, HIPAA/HITECH, and FedRAMP industry requirements.</p> 
           <p> Using an encryption client library, such as the <a href="http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AWSJavaSDK/latest/javadoc/com/amazonaws/services/s3/AmazonS3EncryptionClient.html" target="_blank">Amazon S3 Encryption Client</a>, you retain control of the keys and complete the encryption and decryption of objects client-side using an encryption library of your choice. Some customers prefer full end-to-end control of the encryption and decryption of objects; that way, only encrypted objects are transmitted over the Internet to Amazon S3. Use a client-side library if you want to maintain control of your encryption keys, are able to implement or use a client-side encryption library, and need to have your objects encrypted before they are sent to Amazon S3 for storage.</p>

           <p><b>Q:&nbsp; How does Amazon Macie secure your data?</b></p> 
           <p> As part of the data classification process, Amazon Macie identifies customers’ objects in their S3 buckets, and streams the object contents into memory for analysis. When deeper analysis is required for complex file formats, Amazon Macie will download a full copy of the object, only keeping it for the short time it takes to fully analyze the object. Immediately after Amazon Macie has analyzed the file content for data classification, it deletes the stored content and only retains the metadata required for future analysis. At any time, customers can revoke Amazon Macie access to data in the Amazon S3 bucket.

          <div class="lb-txt-16 lb-rtxt" style="color:#232F3E;"> 
           <p><b>Q:&nbsp; How durable is Amazon S3?</b></p> 
           <p>Amazon S3 Standard, S3 Standard–IA, S3 One Zone-IA, and S3 Glacier are all designed to provide 99.999999999% durability of objects over a given year. This durability level corresponds to an average annual expected loss of 0.000000001% of objects. For example, if you store 10,000,000 objects with Amazon S3, you can on average expect to incur a loss of a single object once every 10,000 years. In addition, Amazon S3 Standard, S3 Standard-IA, and S3 Glacier are all designed to sustain data in the event of an entire S3 Availability Zone loss.</p> 
           <p>As with any environment, the best practice is to have a backup and to put in place safeguards against malicious or accidental deletion. For S3 data, that best practice includes secure access permissions, Cross-Region Replication, versioning, and a functioning, regularly tested backup.&nbsp;</p> 
          </div> 
          <div class="lb-txt-16 lb-rtxt" style="color:#232F3E;"> 
           <p><b>Q:&nbsp; How are Amazon S3 and Amazon S3 Glacier designed to achieve 99.999999999% durability?</b></p> 
           <p>Amazon S3 Standard, S3 Standard-IA, and S3 Glacier storage classes redundantly store your objects on multiple devices across a minimum of three Availability Zones (AZs) in an Amazon S3 Region before returning SUCCESS. The S3 One Zone-IA storage class stores data redundantly across multiple devices within a single AZ. These services are designed to sustain concurrent device failures by quickly detecting and repairing any lost redundancy, and they also regularly verify the integrity of your data using checksums.</p> 
          </div> 
          <div class="lb-txt-16 lb-rtxt" style="color:#232F3E;"> 
           <p><b>Q:&nbsp; What checksums does Amazon S3 employ to detect data corruption?</b></p> 
           <p> Amazon S3 uses a combination of Content-MD5 checksums and cyclic redundancy checks (CRCs) to detect data corruption. Amazon S3 performs these checksums on data at rest and repairs any corruption using redundant data. In addition, the service calculates checksums on all network traffic to detect corruption of data packets when storing or retrieving data.</p>

          <div class="lb-txt-16 lb-rtxt" style="color:#232F3E;"> 
           <p><b>Q:&nbsp; What is Versioning? </b></p> 
           <p> Versioning allows you to preserve, retrieve, and restore every version of every object stored in an Amazon S3 bucket. Once you enable Versioning for a bucket, Amazon S3 preserves existing objects anytime you perform a PUT, POST, COPY, or DELETE operation on them. By default, GET requests will retrieve the most recently written version. Older versions of an overwritten or deleted object can be retrieved by specifying a version in the request.</p> 
          </div> 
          <div class="lb-txt-16 lb-rtxt" style="color:#232F3E;"> 
           <p><b>Q:&nbsp; Why should I use Versioning?</b></p> 
           <p> Amazon S3 provides customers with a highly durable storage infrastructure. Versioning offers an additional level of protection by providing a means of recovery when customers accidentally overwrite or delete objects. This allows you to easily recover from unintended user actions and application failures. You can also use Versioning for data retention and archiving.</p> 
          </div> 
          <div class="lb-txt-16 lb-rtxt" style="color:#232F3E;"> 
           <p><b>Q:&nbsp; How do I start using Versioning?</b></p> 
           <p> You can start using Versioning by enabling a setting on your Amazon S3 bucket. For more information on how to enable Versioning, please refer to the <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/ObjectVersioning.html" target="_blank">Amazon S3 Technical Documentation</a>. <br /> </p>

          <div class="lb-txt-16 lb-rtxt" style="color:#232F3E;"> 
           <p><b>Q:&nbsp; How does Versioning protect me from accidental deletion of my objects?</b></p> 
           <p>When a user performs a DELETE operation on an object, subsequent simple (un-versioned) requests will no longer retrieve the object. However, all versions of that object will continue to be preserved in your Amazon S3 bucket and can be retrieved or restored. Only the owner of an Amazon S3 bucket can permanently delete a version. You can set&nbsp;<a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/object-lifecycle-mgmt.html" target="_blank">Lifecycle rules</a>&nbsp;to manage the lifetime and the cost of storing multiple versions of your objects.</p>

          <div class="lb-txt-16 lb-rtxt" style="color:#232F3E;"> 
           <p><b>Q:&nbsp; How can I ensure maximum protection of my preserved versions?</b></p> 
           <p>Versioning’s <a href="/mfa/" target="_blank">Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)</a> Delete capability can be used to provide an additional layer of security. By default, all requests to your Amazon S3 bucket require your AWS account credentials. If you enable Versioning with MFA Delete on your Amazon S3 bucket, two forms of authentication are required to permanently delete a version of an object: your AWS account credentials and a valid six-digit code and serial number from an authentication device in your physical possession. To learn more about enabling Versioning with MFA Delete, including how to purchase and activate an authentication device, please refer to the <a href="http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/Versioning.html" target="_blank">Amazon S3 Technical Documentation</a>.</p>

           <p>Normal Amazon S3 rates apply for every version of an object stored or requested. For example, let’s look at the following scenario to illustrate storage costs when utilizing Versioning (let’s assume the current month is 31 days long):</p> 
           <p>1) Day 1 of the month: You perform a PUT of 4 GB (4,294,967,296 bytes) on your bucket.<br /> 2) Day 16 of the month: You perform a PUT of 5 GB (5,368,709,120 bytes) within the same bucket using the same key as the original PUT on Day 1.<br /> <br /> When analyzing the storage costs of the above operations, please note that the 4 GB object from Day 1 is not deleted from the bucket when the 5 GB object is written on Day 15. Instead, the 4 GB object is preserved as an older version and the 5 GB object becomes the most recently written version of the object within your bucket. At the end of the month:</p> 
           <p>Total Byte-Hour usage<br /> [4,294,967,296 bytes x 31 days x (24 hours / day)] + [5,368,709,120 bytes x 16 days x (24 hours / day)] = 5,257,039,970,304 Byte-Hours.</p> 
           <p>Conversion to Total GB-Months<br /> 5,257,039,970,304 Byte-Hours x (1 GB / 1,073,741,824 bytes) x (1 month / 744 hours) = 6.581 GB-Month</p>

           <p>Amazon S3 Intelligent-Tiering (S3 Intelligent-Tiering) is an S3 storage class for data with unknown access patterns or changing access patterns that are difficult to learn. It is the first cloud storage class that delivers automatic cost savings by moving objects between two access tiers when access patterns change. One tier is optimized for frequent access and the other lower-cost tier is designed for infrequent access.</p> 
           <p>Objects uploaded or transitioned to S3 Intelligent-Tiering are automatically stored in the frequent access tier. S3 Intelligent-Tiering works by monitoring access patterns and then moving the objects that have not been accessed in 30 consecutive days to the infrequent access tier. If the objects are accessed later, S3 Intelligent-Tiering moves the object back to the frequent access tier. This means all objects stored in S3 Intelligent-Tiering are always available when needed. There are no retrieval fees, so you won’t see unexpected increases in storage bills when access patterns change.</p>

           <p><b>Q:&nbsp; Why would I choose to use S3 Intelligent-Tiering?</b></p> 
           <p>S3 Intelligent-Tiering is for data with unknown access patterns or changing access patterns that are difficult to learn. It is ideal for data sets where you may not be able to anticipate access patterns. S3 Intelligent-Tiering can also be used to store new data sets where, shortly after upload, access is frequent, but decreases as the data set ages. Then you can move the data set to S3 One Zone-IA or archive it to S3 Glacier.<br /> </p>

           <p>Like S3 Standard-IA, S3 One Zone-IA charges for the amount of storage per month, bandwidth, requests, early delete and small object fees, and a data retrieval fee. Amazon S3 One Zone-IA storage is 20% cheaper than Amazon S3 Standard-IA for storage by month, and shares the same pricing for bandwidth, requests, early delete and small object fees, and the data retrieval fee.</p> 
           <p>As with S3 Standard-Infrequent Access, if you delete a S3 One Zone-IA object within 30 days of creating it, you will incur an early delete charge. For example, if you PUT an object and then delete it 10 days later, you are still charged for 30 days of storage.</p> 
           <p>Like S3 Standard-IA, S3 One Zone-IA storage class has a minimum object size of 128KB. Objects smaller than 128KB in size will incur storage charges as if the object were 128KB. For example, a 6KB object in a S3 One Zone-IA storage class will incur storage charges for 6KB and an additional minimum object size fee equivalent to 122KB at the S3 One Zone-IA storage price.

           <p>Each Availability Zone uses redundant power and networking. Within an AWS Region, Availability Zones are on different flood plains, earthquake fault zones, and geographically separated for fire protection. S3 Standard and S3 Standard-IA storage classes offer protection against these sorts of disasters by storing your data redundantly in multiple Availability Zones. S3 One Zone-IA offers protection against equipment failure within an Availability Zone, but it does not protect against the loss of the Availability Zone, in which case, data stored in S3 One Zone-IA would be lost. Using S3 One Zone-IA, S3 Standard, and S3 Standard-IA options, you can choose the storage class that best fits the durability and availability needs of your storage.</p>

           <p><b>Q: Why is Amazon Glacier now called Amazon S3 Glacier?</b></p> 
           <p>Customers have long thought of Amazon Glacier, our backup and archival storage service, as a storage class of Amazon S3. In fact, a very high percentage of the data stored in Amazon Glacier today comes directly from customers using S3 Lifecycle policies to move cooler data into Amazon Glacier. Now, Amazon Glacier is officially part of S3 and will be known as Amazon S3 Glacier (S3 Glacier). All of the existing Glacier direct APIs continue to work just as they have, but we’ve now made it even easier to use the S3 APIs to store data in the S3 Glacier storage class.<br /> </p>

           <p><b>Q:&nbsp; Does Amazon S3 provide capabilities for archiving objects to lower cost storage classes?</b></p> 
           <p>Yes, Amazon S3 enables you to utilize Amazon S3 Glacier’s extremely <a href="/glacier/" target="_blank">low-cost storage service for data archival</a>. Amazon S3 Glacier stores data for as little as $0.004 per gigabyte per month. To keep costs low yet suitable for varying retrieval needs, Amazon S3 Glacier provides three options for access to archives, ranging from a few minutes to several hours. Some examples of archive uses cases include digital media archives, financial and healthcare records, raw genomic sequence data, long-term database backups, and data that must be retained for regulatory compliance.<br /> </p>

          <div class="lb-txt-16 lb-rtxt" style="color:#232F3E;"> 
           <p><b>Q:&nbsp; How can I store my data using the Amazon S3 Glacier storage class?</b></p> 
           <p> If you have storage which should be immediately archived without delay, or if you make custom business decisions about when to transition objects to S3 Glacier that can’t be expressed through an Amazon S3 Lifecycle policy, S3 PUT to Glacier allows you to use S3 APIs to upload to the S3 Glacier storage class on an object-by-object basis. There are no transition delays and you control the timing. This is also a good option if you want your application to make storage class decisions without having to set a bucket-level policy.</p> 
           <p>You can use <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/object-lifecycle-mgmt.html" target="_blank">Lifecycle rules</a>&nbsp;to automatically archive sets of Amazon S3 objects to S3 Glacier based on object age. Use the Amazon S3 Management Console, the AWS SDKs, or the Amazon S3 APIs to define rules for archival. Rules specify a prefix and time period. The prefix (e.g. “logs/”) identifies the object(s) subject to the rule. The time period specifies either the number of days from object creation date (e.g. 180 days) or the specified date after which the object(s) should be archived. Any S3 Standard, S3 Standard-IA, or S3 One Zone-IA objects which have names beginning with the specified prefix and which have aged past the specified time period are archived to S3 Glacier. To retrieve Amazon S3 data stored in S3 Glacier, initiate a retrieval job via the Amazon S3 APIs or Management Console. Once the retrieval job is complete, you can access your data through an Amazon S3 GET object request.</p> 
           <p>For more information on using Lifecycle rules for archival to S3 Glacier, please refer to the <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/object-archival.html" target="_blank">Object Archival</a> topic in the Amazon S3 Developer Guide.</p>

           <p><b>Q:&nbsp; Can I use the Amazon S3 APIs or Management Console to list objects that I’ve archived to Amazon S3 Glacier?</b></p> 
           <p>Yes, like Amazon S3’s other storage classes (S3 Standard, S3 Standard-IA, and S3 One Zone-IA), S3 Glacier objects stored using Amazon S3’s APIs or Management Console have an associated user-defined name. You can get a real-time list of all of your Amazon S3 object names, including those stored using the S3 Glacier storage class, using the S3 LIST API or the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/storage-inventory.html" target="_blank">S3 Inventory report</a>.</p>

           <p><b>Q:&nbsp; Can I use Amazon Glacier direct APIs to access objects that I’ve archived to Amazon S3 Glacier?</b></p> 
           <p>Because Amazon S3 maintains the mapping between your user-defined object name and Amazon S3 Glacier’s system-defined identifier, Amazon S3 objects that are stored using the S3 Glacier storage class are only accessible through the Amazon S3 APIs or the Amazon S3 Management Console.</p>

           <p><b>Q: How can I retrieve my objects that are archived in Amazon S3 Glacier and will I be notified when the object is restored?</b></p> 
           <p>To retrieve Amazon S3 data stored in the S3 Glacier storage class, initiate a retrieval request using the Amazon S3 APIs or the Amazon S3 Management Console. The retrieval request creates a temporary copy of your data in the S3 RRS or S3 Standard-IA storage class while leaving the archived data intact in S3 Glacier. You can specify the amount of time in days for which the temporary copy is stored in S3. You can then access your temporary copy from S3 through an Amazon S3 GET request on the archived object.</p> 
           <p>With restore notifications, you can now be notified with an <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/NotificationHowTo.html" target="_blank">S3 Event Notification</a> when an object has successfully restored from S3 Glacier and the temporary copy is made available to you. The bucket owner (or others, as permitted by an <a href="/iam/" target="_blank">IAM</a> policy) can arrange for notifications to be issued to <a href="/sqs/" target="_blank">Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS)</a> or <a href="/sns/" target="_blank">Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS)</a>. Notifications can also be delivered to <a href="/lambda/" target="_blank">AWS Lambda</a> for processing by a Lambda function.<br /> </p>

           <p><b>Q: How long will it take to restore my objects archived in S3 Glacier and can I upgrade an in-progress request to a faster restore speed?</b></p> 
           <p>When processing a retrieval job, Amazon S3 first retrieves the requested data from S3 Glacier, and then creates a temporary copy of the requested data in S3 (which typically takes a few minutes). The access time of your request depends on the retrieval option you choose: Expedited, Standard, or Bulk retrievals. For all but the largest objects (250MB+), data accessed using Expedited retrievals are typically made available within 1-5 minutes. Objects retrieved using Standard retrievals typically complete between 3-5 hours. Bulk retrievals typically complete within 5-12 hours. For more information about S3 Glacier retrieval options, please refer to the <a href="/glacier/faqs/" target="_blank">S3 Glacier FAQs</a>.</p> 
           <p>S3 Restore Speed Upgrade is an override of an in-progress restore to a faster restore tier if access to the data becomes urgent. You can use S3 Restore Speed Upgrade by issuing another restore request to the same object with a new “tier” job parameter. When issuing an S3 Restore Speed Upgrade, you must choose a faster restore speed than the in-progress restore. Other parameters such as <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/RESTObjectPOSTrestore.html" target="_blank">Object Expiry Time</a> will not be changed. You can update the Object Expiry Time after the restore is complete. You pay for each restore request and the per-GB retrieval charge for the faster restore tier. For example, if you issued a Bulk tier restore and then issued an S3 Restore Speed Upgrade request at the Expedited tier to override the in-progress Bulk tier restore, you would be charged for two requests and the per-GB retrieval charge for the Expedited tier.<br /> </p>

           <p><b>Q:&nbsp; What am I charged for archiving objects in Amazon S3 Glacier?</b></p> 
           <p>Amazon S3 Glacier storage class is priced based on monthly storage capacity and the number of&nbsp; Lifecycle transition requests into Amazon S3 Glacier. Objects that are archived to Amazon S3 Glacier have a minimum of 90 days of storage, and objects deleted before 90 days incur a pro-rated charge equal to the storage charge for the remaining days. See the <a href="/s3/pricing/" target="_blank">Amazon S3 pricing page</a> for current pricing.</p>

           <p><b>Q:&nbsp; How is my storage charge calculated for Amazon S3 objects archived to Amazon S3 Glacier?</b></p> 
           <p>The volume of storage billed in a month is based on average storage used throughout the month, measured in gigabyte-months (GB-Months). Amazon S3 calculates the object size as the amount of data you stored plus an additional 32KB of Amazon S3 Glacier data plus an additional 8KB of S3 Standard storage class data. Amazon S3 Glacier requires an additional 32KB of data per object for Glacier’s index and metadata so you can identify and retrieve your data. Amazon S3 requires 8KB to store and maintain the user-defined name and metadata for objects archived to Amazon S3 Glacier. This enables you to get a real-time list of all of your Amazon S3 objects, including those stored using the Amazon S3 Glacier storage class, using the Amazon S3 LIST API or the S3 Inventory report. For example, if you have archived 100,000 objects that are 1GB each, your billable storage would be:</p> 
           <p>1.000032 gigabytes for each object x 100,000 objects = 100,003.2 gigabytes of Amazon S3 Glacier storage.<br /> 0.000008 gigabytes for each object x 100,000 objects = 0.8 gigabytes of Amazon S3 Standard storage.</p> 
           <p>The fee is calculated based on the current rates for your AWS Region on the <a href="/s3/pricing/" target="_blank">Amazon S3 Pricing Page</a>.</p>

           <p>Amazon S3 Glacier is designed for use cases where data is retained for months, years, or decades. Deleting data that is archived to Amazon S3 Glacier is free if the objects being deleted have been archived in Amazon S3 Glacier for 90 days or longer. If an object archived in Amazon S3 Glacier is deleted or overwritten within 90 days of being archived, there will be an early deletion fee. This fee is prorated. If you delete 1GB of data 30 days after uploading it, you will be charged an early deletion fee for 60 days of Amazon S3 Glacier storage. If you delete 1 GB of data after 60 days, you will be charged for 30 days of Amazon S3 Glacier storage.<br /> </p>

           <p>S3 Select provides a new way to retrieve specific data using SQL statements from the contents of an object stored in Amazon S3 without having to retrieve the entire object. S3 Select simplifies and improves the performance of scanning and filtering the contents of objects into a smaller, targeted dataset by up to 400%. With S3 Select, you can also perform operational investigations on log files in Amazon S3 without the need to operate or manage a compute cluster.</p>

           <p><b>Q:&nbsp; What is Amazon Athena? </b></p> 
           <p> Amazon Athena is an interactive query service that makes it easy to <a href="/athena/" target="_blank">analyze data in Amazon S3 using standard SQL queries</a>. Athena is serverless, so there is no infrastructure to setup or manage, and you can start analyzing data immediately. You don’t even need to load your data into Athena, it works directly with data stored in any S3 storage class. To get started, just log into the Athena Management Console, define your schema, and start querying. Amazon Athena uses Presto with full standard SQL support and works with a variety of standard data formats, including CSV, JSON, ORC, Apache Parquet and Avro. While Athena is ideal for quick, ad-hoc querying and integrates with Amazon QuickSight for easy visualization, it can also handle complex analysis, including large joins, window functions, and arrays. <br /> </p>

           <p><b>Q:&nbsp; What is Amazon Redshift Spectrum?</b></p> 
           <p>Amazon Redshift Spectrum is a feature of Amazon Redshift that enables you to <a href="/redshift/features/">run queries against exabytes of unstructured data in Amazon S3</a>&nbsp;with no loading or ETL required. When you issue a query, it goes to the Amazon Redshift SQL endpoint, which generates and optimizes a query plan. Amazon Redshift determines what data is local and what is in Amazon S3, generates a plan to minimize the amount of Amazon S3 data that needs to be read, requests Redshift Spectrum workers out of a shared resource pool to read and process data from Amazon S3.</p> 
           <p>Redshift Spectrum scales out to thousands of instances if needed, so queries run quickly regardless of data size. And, you can use the exact same SQL for Amazon S3 data as you do for your Amazon Redshift queries today and connect to the same Amazon Redshift endpoint using the same BI tools. Redshift Spectrum lets you separate storage and compute, allowing you to scale each independently. You can setup as many Amazon Redshift clusters as you need to query your Amazon S3 data lake, providing high availability and limitless concurrency. Redshift Spectrum gives you the freedom to store your data where you want, in the format you want, and have it available for processing when you need it.</p>

          <div class="lb-txt-16 lb-rtxt" style="color:#232F3E;"> 
           <p><b>Q:&nbsp; What is S3 Transfer Acceleration? </b></p> 
           <p> Amazon S3 Transfer Acceleration enables fast, easy, and secure transfers of files over long distances between your client and your Amazon S3 bucket. S3 Transfer Acceleration leverages Amazon CloudFront’s globally distributed AWS Edge Locations. As data arrives at an AWS Edge Location, data is routed to your Amazon S3 bucket over an optimized network path.</p> 
          </div> 
          <div class="lb-txt-16 lb-rtxt" style="color:#232F3E;"> 
           <p><b>Q:&nbsp;&nbsp; How do I get started with S3 Transfer Acceleration? </b></p> 
           <p> To get started with S3 Transfer Acceleration <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/transfer-acceleration.html#transfer-acceleration-getting-started" target="_blank">enable S3 Transfer Acceleration</a> on an S3 bucket using the Amazon S3 console, the Amazon S3 API, or the AWS CLI. After S3 Transfer Acceleration is enabled, you can point your Amazon S3 PUT and GET requests to the s3-accelerate endpoint domain name. Your data transfer application must use one of the following two types of endpoints to access the bucket for faster data transfer: .s3-accelerate.amazonaws.com or .s3-accelerate.dualstack.amazonaws.com for the “dual-stack” endpoint. If you want to use standard data transfer, you can continue to use the regular endpoints.</p> 
           <p> There are certain restrictions on which buckets will support S3 Transfer Acceleration. For details, please refer the <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/transfer-acceleration.html#transfer-acceleration-requirements" target="_blank">Amazon S3 developer guide</a>.</p>

          <div class="lb-txt-16 lb-rtxt" style="color:#232F3E;"> 
           <p><b>Q:&nbsp;&nbsp; How fast is S3 Transfer Acceleration? </b></p> 
           <p> S3 Transfer Acceleration helps you fully utilize your bandwidth, minimize the effect of distance on throughput, and is designed to ensure consistently fast data transfer to Amazon S3 regardless of your client’s location. The amount of acceleration primarily depends on your available bandwidth, the distance between the source and destination, and packet loss rates on the network path. Generally, you will see more acceleration when the source is farther from the destination, when there is more available bandwidth, and/or when the object size is bigger.</p> 
           <p> One customer measured a 50% reduction in their average time to ingest 300 MB files from a global user base spread across the US, Europe, and parts of Asia to a bucket in the Asia Pacific (Sydney) region. Another customer observed cases where performance improved in excess of 500% for users in South East Asia and Australia uploading 250 MB files (in parts of 50MB) to an S3 bucket in the US East (N. Virginia) region.</p>

           <p><b>Q: Who should use S3 Transfer Acceleration?</b></p> 
           <p> S3 Transfer Acceleration is designed to optimize transfer speeds from across the world into S3 buckets. If you are uploading to a centralized bucket from geographically dispersed locations, or if you regularly transfer GBs or TBs of data across continents, you may save hours or days of data transfer time with S3 Transfer Acceleration.</p> 
          </div> 
          <div class="lb-txt-16 lb-rtxt" style="color:#232F3E;"> 
           <p><b>Q:&nbsp;&nbsp; How secure is S3 Transfer Acceleration? </b></p> 
           <p> S3 Transfer Acceleration provides the same security as regular transfers to Amazon S3. All Amazon S3 security features, such as access restriction based on a client’s IP address, are supported as well. S3 Transfer Acceleration communicates with clients over standard TCP and does not require firewall changes. No data is ever saved at AWS Edge Locations.</p> 
          </div> 
          <div class="lb-txt-16 lb-rtxt" style="color:#232F3E;"> 
           <p><b>Q:&nbsp; &nbsp; What if S3 Transfer Acceleration is not faster than a regular Amazon S3 transfer? </b></p> 
           <p> Each time you use S3 Transfer Acceleration to upload an object, we will check whether S3 Transfer Acceleration is likely to be faster than a regular Amazon S3 transfer. If we determine that S3 Transfer Acceleration is not likely to be faster than a regular Amazon S3 transfer of the same object to the same destination AWS Region, we will not charge for the use of S3 Transfer Acceleration for that transfer, and we may bypass the S3 Transfer Acceleration system for that upload.</p>

           <p><b>Q:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; How should I choose between S3 Transfer Acceleration and Amazon CloudFront’s PUT/POST? </b></p> 
           <p> S3 Transfer Acceleration optimizes the TCP protocol and adds additional intelligence between the client and the S3 bucket, making S3 Transfer Acceleration a better choice if a higher throughput is desired. If you have objects that are smaller than 1GB or if the data set is less than 1GB in size, you should consider using Amazon CloudFront's PUT/POST commands for optimal performance.</p> 
          </div> 
          <div class="lb-txt-16 lb-rtxt" style="color:#232F3E;"> 
           <p><b>Q:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; How should I choose between S3 Transfer Acceleration and AWS Snow Family (Snowball, Snowball Edge, and Snowmobile)? </b></p> 
           <p> The AWS Snow Family is ideal for customers moving large batches of data at once. The AWS Snowball has a typical 5-7 days turnaround time. As a rule of thumb, S3 Transfer Acceleration over a fully-utilized 1 Gbps line can transfer up to 75 TBs in the same time period. In general, if it will take more than a week to transfer over the Internet, or there are recurring transfer jobs and there is more than 25Mbps of available bandwidth, S3 Transfer Acceleration is a good option. Another option is to use both: perform initial heavy lift moves with an AWS Snowball (or series of AWS Snowballs) and then transfer incremental ongoing changes with S3 Transfer Acceleration.</p>

           <p><b>Q:&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Can S3 Transfer Acceleration complement AWS Direct Connect? </b></p> 
           <p> AWS Direct Connect is a good choice for customers who have a private networking requirement or who have access to AWS Direct Connect exchanges. S3 Transfer Acceleration is best for submitting data from distributed client locations over the public Internet, or where variable network conditions make throughput poor. Some AWS Direct Connect customers use S3 Transfer Acceleration to help with remote office transfers, where they may suffer from poor Internet performance.</p>

           <p><b>Q:&nbsp; What are S3 object tags? </b></p> 
           <p> S3 object tags are key-value pairs applied to S3 objects which can be created, updated or deleted at any time during the lifetime of the object. With these, you’ll have the ability to create Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies, setup S3 Lifecycle policies, and customize storage metrics. These object-level tags can then manage transitions between storage classes and expire objects in the background.</p> 
          </div> 
          <div class="lb-txt-16 lb-rtxt" style="color:#232F3E;"> 
           <p><b>Q:&nbsp; How do I apply object tags to my objects? </b></p> 
           <p> You can add tags to new objects when you upload them or you can add them to existing objects. Up to ten tags can be added to each S3 object and you can use either the AWS Management Console, the REST API, the AWS CLI, or the AWS SDKs to add object tags.</p>

           <p><b>Q:&nbsp; Why should I use object tags?</b></p> 
           <p>Object tags are a tool you can use to enable simple management of your S3 storage. With the ability to create, update, and delete tags at any time during the lifetime of your object, your storage can adapt to the needs of your business. These tags allow you to control access to objects tagged with specific key-value pairs, allowing you to further secure confidential data for only a select group or user.&nbsp;Object tags can also be used to label objects that belong to a specific project or business unit, which could be used in conjunction with S3 Lifecycle policies to manage transitions to other storage classes (S3 Standard-IA, S3 One Zone-IA, and S3 Glacier) or with S3 Cross-Region Replication to selectively replicate data between AWS Regions.<br /> </p>

           <p><b>Q:&nbsp; What is S3 Batch Operations? <br /> </b></p> 
           <p>S3 Batch Operations is a feature that you can use to automate the execution, management, and auditing of a specific S3 request or Lambda function across many objects stored in Amazon S3. You can use S3 Batch Operations to automate replacing tag sets on S3 objects, updating access control lists (ACL) for S3 objects, copying storage between buckets, initiating a restore from Glacier to S3, or performing custom operations with Lambda functions. S3 Batch Operations can be used from the S3 console, or through the AWS CLI and SDK.</p> 
          </div> 
          <div class="lb-txt-16 lb-rtxt" style="color:#232F3E;"> 
           <p><b>Q:&nbsp; Why should I use S3 Batch Operations?<br /> </b></p> 
           <p>You should use S3 Batch Operations if you want to automate the execution of a single operation (like copying an object, or executing an AWS Lambda function) across many objects. With S3 Batch Operations, you can, with a few clicks in the S3 console or a single API request, make a change to billions of objects without having to write custom application code or run compute clusters for storage management applications. Not only does S3 Batch Operations administer your storage operation across many objects, S3 Batch Operations manages retries, displays progress, delivers notifications, provides a completion report, and sends events to AWS CloudTrail for all operations performed on your target objects.&nbsp;If you are interested in learning more about S3 Batch Operations, go to the <a href="/s3/features/">Amazon S3 features page</a>.</p>

          <div class="lb-txt-16 lb-rtxt" style="color:#232F3E;"> 
           <p><b>Q:&nbsp; How do I get started with S3 Batch Operations?<br /> </b></p> 
           <p>You can get started with S3 Batch Operations by going into the Amazon S3 console or using the AWS CLI or SDK to create your first S3 Batch Operations job. A S3 Batch Operations job consists of the list of objects to act upon and the type of operation to be performed. Start by selecting an S3 Inventory report or providing your own custom list of objects for S3 Batch Operations to act upon. An S3 Inventory report is a file listing all objects stored in an S3 bucket or prefix. Next, you choose from a set of S3 operations supported by S3 Batch Operations, such as replacing tag sets, changing ACLs, copying storage from one bucket to another, or initiating a restore from Glacier to S3. You can then customize your S3 Batch Operations jobs with specific parameters such as tag values, ACL grantees, and restoration duration. To further customize your storage actions, you can write your own Lambda function and invoke that code through S3 Batch Operations.</p> 
           <p>Once you create your S3 Batch Operations job, S3 Batch Operations will process your list of objects and send the job to the “awaiting confirmation” state if required. After you confirm the job details, S3 Batch Operations will begin executing the operation you specified. You can view your job’s progress programmatically or through the S3 console, receive notifications on completion, and review a completion report that itemizes the changes made to your storage.<br /> </p>

           <p> <b>Q: What is Amazon S3 Object Lock?</b></p> 
           <p> Amazon S3 Object Lock is a new Amazon S3 feature that blocks object version deletion during a customer-defined retention period so that you can enforce retention policies as an added layer of data protection or for regulatory compliance. You can migrate workloads from existing write-once-read-many (WORM) systems into Amazon S3, and configure S3 Object Lock at the object- and bucket-levels to prevent object version deletions prior to pre-defined Retain Until Dates or Legal Hold Dates. S3 Object Lock protection is maintained regardless of which storage class the object resides in and throughout S3 Lifecycle transitions between storage classes.<br /> </p> 
          </div> 
          <div class="lb-txt-16 lb-rtxt" style="color:#232F3E;"> 
           <p> <b>Q: Why should you use Amazon S3 Object Lock?</b></p> 
           <p> You should use S3 Object Lock if you have regulatory requirements that specify that data must be WORM protected, or if you want to add an additional layer of protection to data in Amazon S3. S3 Object Lock can help you to meet regulatory requirements that specify that data should be stored in an immutable format, and also can protect against accidental or malicious deletion for data in Amazon S3.<br /> </p> 
          </div> 
          <div class="lb-txt-16 lb-rtxt" style="color:#232F3E;"> 
           <p><b>Q: How does Amazon S3 Object Lock work?</b></p> 
           <p>Amazon S3 Object Lock blocks deletion of an object for the duration of a specified retention period. Coupled with S3 Versioning, which protects objects from being overwritten, you’re able to ensure that objects remain immutable for as long as WORM protection is applied. You can apply WORM protection by either assigning a Retain Until Date or a Legal Hold to an object using the AWS SDK, CLI, REST API, or the S3 Management Console. You can apply retention settings within a PUT request, or apply them to an existing object after it has been created.</p> 
           <p>The Retain Until Date defines the length of time for which an object will remain immutable. Once a Retain Until Date has been assigned to an object, that object cannot be modified or deleted until the Retain Until Date has passed. If a user attempts to delete an object before its Retain Until Date has passed, the operation will be denied.</p> 
           <p>S3 Object Lock can be configured in one of two Modes. When deployed in Governance Mode, AWS accounts with specific IAM permissions are able to remove WORM protection from an object. If you require stronger immutability in order to comply with regulations, you can use Compliance Mode. In Compliance Mode, WORM protection cannot be removed by any user, including the root account.</p> 
           <p>Alternatively, you can make an object immutable by applying a Legal Hold to that object. A Legal Hold places indefinite S3 Object Lock protection on an object, which will remain until it is explicitly removed. In order to place and remove Legal Holds, your AWS account must have write permission for the PutObjectLegalHold action. Legal Hold can be applied to any object in an S3 Object Lock enabled bucket, whether or not that object is currently WORM-protected by a retention period.<br /> </p>

           <p> <b>Q: What AWS electronic storage services have been assessed based on financial services regulations?</b></p> 
           <p> For customers in the financial services industry, S3 Object Lock provides added support for broker-dealers who must retain records in a non-erasable and non-rewritable format to satisfy regulatory requirements of SEC Rule 17a-4(f), FINRA Rule 4511, or CFTC Regulation 1.31. You can easily designate the records retention time frame to retain regulatory archives in the original form for the required duration, and also place legal holds to retain data indefinitely until the hold is removed.<br /> </p>

           <p><b>Q:&nbsp; What is S3 Lifecycle management?</b></p> 
           <p>S3 Lifecycle management provides the ability to define the lifecycle of your object with a predefined policy and reduce your cost of storage. You can set a lifecycle transition policy to automatically migrate objects stored in the S3 Standard storage class to the S3 Standard-IA, S3 One Zone-IA, and/or S3 Glacier storage classes based on the age of the data. You can also set lifecycle expiration policies to automatically remove objects based on the age of the object. You can set a policy for multipart upload expiration, which expires incomplete multipart uploads based on the age of the upload.</p> 
          </div> 
          <div class="lb-txt-16 lb-rtxt" style="color:#232F3E;"> 
           <p><b>Q:&nbsp; How do I set up an S3 Lifecycle management policy?</b></p> 
           <p> You can set up and manage Lifecycle policies in the AWS Management Console, S3 REST API, AWS SDKs, or AWS Command Line Interface (CLI). You can specify the policy at the prefix or at the bucket level. <br /> </p>

          <div class="lb-txt-16 lb-rtxt" style="color:#232F3E;"> 
           <p><b>Q:&nbsp; How much does it cost to use S3 Lifecycle management? </b></p> 
           <p> There is no additional cost to set up and apply Lifecycle policies. A transition request is charged per object when an object becomes eligible for transition according to the Lifecycle rule. Refer to the <a href="/s3/pricing/" target="_blank">S3 Pricing page</a> for pricing information. <br /> </p> 
          </div> 
          <div class="lb-txt-16 lb-rtxt" style="color:#232F3E;"> 
           <p><b>Q:&nbsp; What can I do with Lifecycle management policies?</b></p> 
           <p>As data matures, it can become less critical, less valuable, and/or subject to compliance requirements. Amazon S3 includes an extensive library of policies that help you automate data migration processes between storage classes. For example, you can set infrequently accessed objects to move into lower cost storage classes (like S3 Standard-IA or S3 One Zone-IA) after a period of time. After another period, those objects can be moved into Amazon S3 Glacier for archive and compliance. If policy allows, you can also specify a lifecycle policy for object deletion. These rules can invisibly lower storage costs and simplify management efforts. These policies also include good stewardship practices to remove objects and attributes that are no longer needed to manage cost and optimize performance.</p> 
          </div> 
          <div class="lb-txt-16 lb-rtxt" style="color:#232F3E;"> 
           <p><b>Q:&nbsp; How can I use Amazon S3 Lifecycle management to help lower my Amazon S3 storage costs?</b></p> 
           <p>With Amazon S3 Lifecycle policies, you can configure your objects to be migrated to from the S3 Standard storage class to S3 Standard-IA or S3 One Zone-IA and/or archived to S3 Glacier. You can also specify an S3 Lifecycle policy to delete objects after a specific period of time. You can use this policy-driven automation to quickly and easily reduce storage costs as well as save time. In each rule you can specify a prefix, a time period, a transition to S3 Standard-IA, S3 One Zone-IA, or S3 Glacier, and/or an expiration. For example, you could create a rule that archives into S3 Glacier all objects with the common prefix “logs/” 30 days from creation and expires these objects after 365 days from creation. You can also create a separate rule that only expires all objects with the prefix “backups/” 90 days from creation. S3 Lifecycle policies apply to both existing and new S3 objects, helping you optimize storage and maximize cost savings for all current data and any new data placed in S3 without time-consuming manual data review and migration. Within a lifecycle rule, the prefix field identifies the objects subject to the rule. To apply the rule to an individual object, specify the key name. To apply the rule to a set of objects, specify their common prefix (e.g. “logs/”). You can specify a transition action to have your objects archived and an expiration action to have your objects removed. For time period, provide the creation date (e.g. January 31, 2015) or the number of days from creation date (e.g. 30 days) after which you want your objects to be archived or removed. You may create multiple rules for different prefixes.</p>

           <p>The S3 Lifecycle policy that expires incomplete multipart uploads allows you to save on costs by limiting the time non-completed multipart uploads are stored. For example, if your application uploads several multipart object parts, but never commits them, you will still be charged for that storage. This policy can lower your S3 storage bill by automatically removing incomplete multipart uploads and the associated storage after a predefined number of days.</p>

           <p>CRR is an Amazon S3 feature that automatically replicates data between AWS Regions. With CRR, you can set up replication at a bucket level, a shared prefix level, or an object level using S3 object tags.&nbsp;You can use CRR to provide lower-latency data access in different geographic regions. CRR can also help if you have a compliance requirement to store copies of data hundreds of miles apart.</p>

           <p><b>Q:&nbsp; How do I enable CRR?</b></p> 
           <p>CRR is configured at the S3 bucket level. You enable a CRR configuration on your source bucket by specifying a destination bucket in a different Region for replication. You can use either the AWS Management Console, the REST API, the AWS CLI, or the AWS SDKs to enable CRR. Versioning must be enabled for both the source and destination buckets to enable CRR.

           <p>You pay the Amazon S3 charges for storage (in the S3 storage class you select), COPY or PUT requests, and inter-region Data Transfer OUT From Amazon S3 for the replicated copy of data. COPY requests and inter-Region data transfer are charged based on the source Region. Storage for replicated data is charged based on the target Region. For more information, please visit the <a href="/s3/pricing/">S3 pricing page</a>.</p> 
           <p>If the source object is uploaded using the multipart upload feature, then it is replicated using the same number of parts and part size. For example, a 100 GB object uploaded using the multipart upload feature (800 parts of 128 MB each) will incur request cost associated with 802 requests (800 Upload Part requests + 1 Initiate Multipart Upload request + 1 Complete Multipart Upload request) when replicated. You will incur a request charge of $0.00401 (802 requests x $0.005 per 1,000 requests) and a charge of $2.00 ($0.020 per GB transferred x 100 GB) for inter-region data transfer. After replication, the 100 GB will incur storage charges based on the destination region.<br /> </p>

           <p>You can get started by pointing your application to Amazon S3’s new “dual-stack” <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/dual-stack-endpoints.html" target="_blank">endpoint</a>, which supports access over both IPv4 and IPv6. In most cases, no further configuration is required for access over IPv6, because most network clients prefer IPv6 addresses by default.<br /> </p> 
          </div> 
          <div class="lb-txt-16 lb-rtxt" style="color:#232F3E;"> 
           <p><b>Q:&nbsp; Should I expect a change in Amazon S3 performance when using IPv6? </b></p> 
           <p> No, you will see the same performance when using either IPv4 or IPv6 with Amazon S3. <br /> </p> 
          </div> 
          <div class="lb-txt-16 lb-rtxt" style="color:#232F3E;"> 
           <p><b>Q:&nbsp;&nbsp; What can I do if my clients are impacted by policy, network, or other restrictions in using IPv6 for Amazon S3? </b></p> 
           <p> Applications that are impacted by using IPv6 can switch back to the standard IPv4-only endpoints at any time.</p> 
          </div> 
          <div class="lb-txt-16 lb-rtxt" style="color:#232F3E;"> 
           <p><b>Q:&nbsp; &nbsp; Can I use IPv6 with all Amazon S3 features? </b></p> 
           <p> No, IPv6 support is not currently available when using Website Hosting and access via BitTorrent. All other features should work as expected when accessing Amazon S3 using IPv6.</p> 
          </div> 
          <div class="lb-txt-16 lb-rtxt" style="color:#232F3E;"> 
           <p><b>Q:&nbsp; &nbsp; Is IPv6 supported in all AWS Regions?</b></p> 
           <p>You can use IPv6 with Amazon S3 in all commercial AWS Regions except China (Beijing) and China (Ningxia). You can also use IPv6 in the AWS GovCloud (US) Region.</p>
